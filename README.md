# Mini Internship Tracker 🎯

## Basic Details

### Team Name:Angel Thomas N

### Team Members
- Member 1: Angel Thomas N - Jyothi Engineering College


### Hosted Project Link
tink-her-hack-temp-seven.vercel.app

### Project Description
This application manages and tracks internship records for students. It allows users to log, update, and monitor internship details, making record-keeping simple and organized

### The Problem statement
Students often struggle to keep track of their internship details, such as company, duration, and tasks completed. Without a centralized system, important information can get lost, making it hard to showcase experience or stay organized

### The Solution
We provide a digital platform where students can easily log, update, and track their internship details in one place. The app organizes information like company name, duration, and tasks completed, helping students stay organized and access their internship records anytime.

#### Diagrams

**System Architecture:**

!A React-Node.js platform for students to log, track, and export internship records through a secure, centralized digital management system.
**Application Workflow:**

Students authenticate, log internship details via React forms, and manage records through a Node.js API that synchronizes with the database.
"The system utilizes a decoupled architecture where a React frontend communicates with a Node.js API to perform secure CRUD operations on student internship data
